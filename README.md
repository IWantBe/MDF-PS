# MDPS

Congratulations, this paper has been accepted by ICME2022 conference!

The MDPS method is very simple, and the code of MDPS (tensorflow) is given, I'm sorry that my code is not very standard, please understand.

ReadData_2.py is "Channel fusion and periodic sampling".
model_2_view.py is the code of training and testing, and it provides functions to evaluate the performance changes under different stripe and sample length.


Thank you very much to Mr. He for reproducing my MDPS method with pytorch, and his Github link is as follows: https://github.com/liguge/MDPS_pytorch
